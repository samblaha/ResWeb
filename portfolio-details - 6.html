              <h2>Guppy: DIY AI Personal Assistant</h2>
              <p>
                Introducing Guppy, a cutting-edge AI assistant designed to run seamlessly on the Raspberry Pi 4, leveraging the robust capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT to bring you an interactive, intelligent companion that's always ready to assist. Built with the power of Python and integrated with OpenAI’s API, Guppy goes beyond simple voice commands, offering users a dynamic, conversational experience that feels both personal and intuitive.
                How It Works:
                At the heart of Guppy lies a sophisticated codebase that harnesses the advanced natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT, enabling it to understand and respond to a wide array of user queries and commands. Here's a glimpse into the inner workings of this remarkable assistant:
                Voice Activation: Guppy listens for a wake word, springing to action when it hears its name. This feature is built on Python's speech recognition library, ensuring that Guppy remains attentive yet unobtrusive, ready to assist at a moment's notice.
                Query Processing: Upon activation, Guppy captures your voice input, converting speech to text. This text is then sent securely to OpenAI's ChatGPT API, where the real magic happens. Guppy's integration with ChatGPT allows it to understand context, remember past interactions, and craft responses that are both relevant and engaging.
                Response Generation: With the processed query, ChatGPT dives into its vast knowledge base to generate a response tailored to the user's request. Whether it's answering questions, offering advice, or just sharing a joke, Guppy ensures that each interaction is as informative as it is delightful.
                Voice Response: Guppy communicates back to the user with a voice response. The text-to-speech functionality is fine-tuned to offer clear, pleasant audio that enriches the conversational experience. This feature embodies Guppy’s commitment to accessibility, ensuring that users can engage with their AI companion naturally and effortlessly.
                Continuous Improvement: Guppy is designed to evolve. Each interaction is an opportunity for learning, allowing Guppy to grow more helpful and responsive over time. Users can expect regular updates that introduce new features, enhance existing functionalities, and expand Guppy’s knowledge base.
                Key Features:
                Interactive Voice Responses: Engage in natural, flowing conversations with Guppy, powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT.
                Raspberry Pi Compatibility: Specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi 4, Guppy is optimized for performance and reliability.
                Secure API Integration: Direct, secure connections to OpenAI's API ensure fast, accurate responses to every query.
